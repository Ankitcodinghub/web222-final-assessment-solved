Overview

The WEB222 final assessment is equivalent to a final exam but can be done remotely and submitted online.

The assessment has three parts and builds on your knowledge from the course to create websites. Specifically, you will be asked to do the following:

1. Create a Multi-Page Website about your Favourite Game (worth 12%)

2. Implement a Static Hosting solution, so it can be viewed online (worth 3%)

3. Create a Reflection Video Walk-Through about the work you did in steps 1 &amp; 2 and upload it to YouTube (worth 5%)

Submission

‚Ä¢ A .zip file of your complete web site code (part 1)

‚Ä¢ A link to your publicly hosted web site (part 2)

‚Ä¢ A link to your private YouTube video (part 3). NOTE: make sure you publish the video unlisted/private, so only the people who have the link can view the video

Honesty Statement:

I also declare that no part of this assignment has been distributed to other students.

Part 1. Website Design (12%)

You are asked to create a multi-page website dedicated to your favourite game. The game might be one you played as a child, could be a card game, sports game, video game, board game, or something else. This website will allow you to show off your skills as a developer to possible employers. You are responsible for researching and implementing all aspects of this website on your own.

Your website will be expected to have the following structure and elements:

‚Ä¢ You must include all of the following pages:

1. index.html: your main landing page. This page should give a short description of the game, include some media (e.g., images, videos, YouTube embed iframes) about the game, and provide details and links to other parts of the site (i.e., make sure the user understands how to use the site and what is included).

At the bottom of the page, include an HTML Form for the user to enter their email address and join the site‚Äôs Newsletter. The form should include three inputs:

a) A single Input element to enter their email. Choose the most appropriate control type and attributes.

b) A hidden Input element with your name. It won‚Äôt be shown to the user but will be submitted with the form data.

c) A ‚ÄúJoin‚Äù Button that submits the form. When the form is submitted, it should POST to https://httpbin.org/post, and only allow the user to submit when a valid email address has been entered.

NOTE: we are only simulating the newsletter sign-up in this assignment by creating the front-end code to accomplish it. You are not responsible for the back-end.

2. info.html: a page that gives more detailed information about the game. It should include three sections with longer text and/or media:

a) the history of the game

b) the rules of game play and/or a description of how to play the game

c) your best tips and strategies for winning

3. reviews.html: a dynamic page with other people‚Äôs reviews of playing the game. The reviews should be shown as ‚Äúcards‚Äù (i.e., a rectangles with appropriate border, colours, text sizes, etc.), which you will generate dynamically when the page loads using JavaScript.

Create a file data.js to hold the review data. This data.js file will be an Array of Objects:

// Attach reviewData to the global window Object

// so other scripts can access it at runtime. window.reviewData = [

/* Your Review Data Goes Here‚Ä¶ */

];

Each Object in reviewData represents a single review and should include:

1) the name of the person

3) a rating 1-5 (e.g., 3) 4) the text of their review.

Create at least 5 review Objects in your data.js file. You can write them yourself or ask your friends and family.

Below the final review, include an HTML Form that allows a new review to be added. Include appropriate HTML Input elements to enter all the necessary fields for a review and use the correct Input Attributes. When the user clicks a ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button at the bottom of the form, use JavaScript to add a new Object to the reviewData Array, then re-generate all the review cards (i.e., clear the cards and reshow them, including the new review just added).

NOTE: the review added by a user won‚Äôt be saved (i.e., will disappear on reload or navigation), which is OK. We are only interested in you showing it in the frontend.

‚Ä¢ Make sure you choose the most appropriate, semantic HTML5 elements for all of your page‚Äôs content (e.g., don‚Äôt use &lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt; for everything) and use them correctly. Your page must be valid HTML5.

‚Ä¢ All CSS and JavaScript should be put in separate .css or .js files (i.e., not embedded in the HTML), and use proper indentation, formatting, and include appropriate comments.

‚Ä¢ Your site should use elements of Responsive Design. That is, it should work equally well, and optimize space and sizes, on both desktop screens (more than 400 px wide) and mobile phones (less than 400 px wide). Research and use CSS Media Queries to define classes and rules that work on a narrow screen (400 pixels or less) vs. your full desktop (greater than 400 pixels). For example, font sizes, margins, layout choices (e.g., removing or moving elements), image sizes, etc. could all be different if viewed on a phone vs. desktop. There are lots of ways to implement a Responsive web site. Research and use a few of these techniques in order to accomplish this requirement.

‚Ä¢ The website‚Äôs pages should be divided into sections using different background colours. On the right is an example image of a website that uses this ‚Äúcoloured sections‚Äù design approach. Use a palette from a site like palettelist.com to help pick your main and accent colours. Make sure all text uses good contrast (text colour vs. background color) for accessibility.

‚Ä¢ Every page should use the same colours, fonts, layout, etc. At the top of each page, duplicate the same header, including navigation to all other pages. NOTE: the exact styling you use is up to you, make it your own, but convey the same general information with the general structure:

o The site‚Äôs title

o A short description of the site

o an image/logo. Make sure you have the rights to use any images you include

o links to all other pages on the site

‚Ä¢ Use two fonts from Google Fonts to improve the website‚Äôs aesthetics: 1) for headings/titles; 2) for all other text.

Part 2. Static Hosting (3%)

You are asked to research and implement a static hosting solution for your web site, so that it is accessible via a public URL. You do not need to spend any money to achieve this, since many free hosting services exist. Here are some possible options:

1. Netlify ‚Äì https://www.netlify.com/

2. CloudFlare ‚Äì https://pages.cloudflare.com/

3. Vercel ‚Äì https://vercel.com/

4. GitHub Pages ‚Äì https://pages.github.com/

Please submit the public URL for your project. All pages, images, etc. must work and not return 404s or other errors.

Part 3. Reflection Video (5%)

Your video should include audio of you talking and a screen-capture or screenshots of all the elements you discuss (i.e., you don‚Äôt have to be on camera if you aren‚Äôt comfortable doing so, it‚Äôs up to you). Use the video to give a walk-through of your website and the technologies you used.

In your reflection, please discuss and demo as much of the following:

‚Ä¢ Give a tour of your website, discussing all areas.

‚Ä¢ Discuss the techniques, technologies, and patterns you used.

‚Ä¢ Discuss the colours and fonts you chose.

‚Ä¢ Which other web sites did you use as inspiration and why?

‚Ä¢ Demonstrate and explain how you made your web site responsive, so that it works well on both phone and desktop browsers. Show how your website adjusts to window sizes less than, and more than, 400 px.

‚Ä¢ Demonstrate the Newsletter Signup feature.

‚Ä¢ Demonstrate how the dynamic Reviews page works, showing how to add a new review and have it appear.

‚Ä¢ Explain some of the main features of HTML Forms and Input elements you used to help make sure the user‚Äôs input was valid for your forms, and to keep them from submitting mistakes.

‚Ä¢ How did you test that your responsive design and web form were both working, and did this testing find any bugs in your implementation? How did you address these?

‚Ä¢ What advice would you give to other web developers building forms for their pages based on your own experience? What lessons did you learn?
